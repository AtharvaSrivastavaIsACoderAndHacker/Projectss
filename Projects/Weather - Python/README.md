# 🌦️ Pygame Weather Visualizer

A graphical weather visualizer built using Pygame. It fetches real-time weather data using the [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/) and visualizes conditions like rain, snow, fog, and more — with ambient sound and animations.

> ⚠️ **Note**: This is a practice project and **not optimized** for production use. It can use ~140MB RAM and ~0.1–0.2 GHz CPU on average.
