CodeWithHarry a coder/coding instructor on YouTube, did a project : SnakeGame in Vanilla JS

He provides Source Code On his website, so I took it from there and Edited It To Give Him Proper Credits !

I Deployed That SnakeGame Implementation Code Using Free Plan Of 000freewebhost.com !

I have given proper credits !

I have also made my own (completely coded myself) SnakeGame in Python Pygame BTW, you can find it on my GitHub !

https://snakemaniacodewithharry.000webhostapp.com/ --> is the URL to the deployed website

Pls don't use this website much coz if my free plan's limits are touched, it'll expire !
