I just love creating 10-15 line python scripts to automate my stuff !

I write git/GitHub commit messages in this format:
		12/1/25 22:15 ++Modded1CppFile(37)

What I used to do, was that I used git log to copy my last commit message, and I changed a few letters to match current date and time and wrote the file changes !

What i came up with, is that i write a python script that takes current date and time, formats it into my string, the format i'm used to, copy the general string in the clipboard, and exit the program !

I'll then compile this into an .exe and add it's path to ENVIRONMENT PATH VARIABLE, then voila, whenever i type the name of the .exe, probably gcmit.exe, the script would execute and exit after copying the format into my clipboard !

Much faster and easier that git commit, copying and editing the date/time !

I know that the amount of time spent on writing this readme and the project (approx. 8-9 mins) is more than enough for me to copy that manually for years, but still we programmers Are lazy, we would walk a km in a single day to avid daily 10 metre walks !

little projects like this cool shit, along with major projects aid your learning !

little projects are underrated, they help much more than you think !
