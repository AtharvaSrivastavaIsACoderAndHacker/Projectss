# goNav – Command Line Directory Alias Navigator
## Atharva Srivastava


**goNav** is a C++ command-line utility that allows users to define aliases for frequently used folder paths and navigate to them easily from a terminal. sadly due to windows's ducking architecture, running this wont change the pwd to the aliased path, instead it will open a new terminal window with the path as the pwd
