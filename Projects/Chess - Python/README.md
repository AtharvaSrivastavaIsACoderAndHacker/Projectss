#  CHESS AI(kinda AI) Python

## I MADE A COOL NEW GAME YK !

### this is just a beginner project made with the aim of learning and is in no way the best chess engine I'll ever make/ or have made !
### this has some issues like it's a little buggy and some of intrinsic chess details like enPassant aren't implemented !
### I started this on 25 May 2024, worked for a week and them left it alnoe on my desktop, I often in months opened and worked on it for a total of like 15 inconsecutive (widespread throughout the year) days! most features were done till Jan 2025, next I touched it today to work on it for the last time and free it from it's miseries, and to dig it's grave in the graveyard of code -- GitHub !

I'm still a learner, and I took on a complex task that's way out of my league to build, that's why I completed it with hacks and bugToFeatureConversions. So I know that this project is Terrible at memoryManagement, it's buggy and lacks minute chess details! the game is unpolished but ` I've given my best to make it as good as possible`
One more thing, this isn't some real AI, just a bunch of if statements at a small level(that;s why the title says "kinda AI") -- the moves are deterministic

> **"One year of calendar time, ~25 days of actual code."**

This project is a large-scale experimental AI logic engine, coded from scratch with the goal of learning long term code management and large software production:
It's Completely written by a human without ML-based training.

##  Known Issues that I haven't ackled cause I'm still learning and it's a learning project

- **Memory Management:** Poor â€” no smart garbage collection or memory pooling.
- **Performance:** Unoptimized recursive patterns.
- **Bugs:** Likely due to rushed end-of-project commits.
- **Predictability:** Deterministic, but complex inputs may cause instability.

##  Development Timeline

- **Start Date:** 25 May 2024  
- **End Date:** 26 May 2025  
- **Actual Dev Time:** ~20â€“25 days (rest was procrastination and planning)

This project was exploratory. Many design inconsistencies exist due to evolving thought processes and late-stage hacks.

## ðŸ“Ž Justa reminder

This is not production-ready software. It is an experiment ! Bugs, inefficiencies, and missing pieces are part of the experience.



# EVEN IF IT'S NOT THE BEST, AND HAS ISSUES BUT FOR ME AT THIS SKILL LEVEL, THIS IS A MILESTONE, AND I LOVE THIS PROJECT
